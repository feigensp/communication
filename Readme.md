The file analysis contains the script that we used to analyze the data and create the plots. We used the library coronet (available at GitHub:https://github.com/ecklbarb/coronet/tree/read-data-from-company). The input data must have the folder structure as discribed in the Readme of the coronet project.

The file analysis.Rmd must be copied in the folder of the coronet library.
